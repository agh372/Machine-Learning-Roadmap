Two fundamental objects are Points and Vectors.

Points - 

Point is a location. It is represented as a "dot".In a coordinate system, we can represent points by coordinates in its system.

In 2d space, the standard coordinate system is Cartesian coordinate system.

A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates


Vectors

It represents change in position.In Euclidean space, it can be viewed as arrow connecting two points.
Properties
 Magnitude which is the length of the arrow
 Direction which direction towads where tip is pointing

Represented by column surrounded by square brackets.

Two vectors are equivalent if they have the same magnitude and direction.

The Zero vector is the one that has all its coordinates equal to 0. The Zero vector has no direction and no normalization.

A unit vector is any vector in which it's magnitude is 1.

The magnitude of the vector can be calculated using pythagorous formula adapted to as many dimensions as the vector has. e.g. 3 dimensions = square-root(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)

The process of finding a unit vector from a given vector is called normalization. There are 2 steps involved when normilizing a vector:

    A. Find magnitude.
    B. Multiply vector by 1/magnitude of vector.

Scalar multiplication

Scalar multiplication is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication. A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication. The common operator, a dot , which operate on two vectors. The product of a scalar c with a vector v can be represented in any of the following fashions:

    c v
    c â‹… v 

It scales the size of vector.



vector addition can be calculated by placing the initial points of the vectors together, completing a parallelogram, and finding the diagonal of the parallelogram.

vector subtraction can be calculated by placing the arrow which connects two arrow heads.
